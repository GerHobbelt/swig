Version 4.3.0 (in progress)
===========================

2024-01-23: wsfulton
            Add missing use of move constructor instead of copy constructor when
            passing movable types by value. This was previously implemented only for
            parameters passed to a global function or static member function and is
            now extended to parameters passed to member methods as well as constructors.

	    [Java] #2819 Suppress Java removal warnings for uses of
	    System.runFinalization().  SWIG will need to stop relying on
	    finalize methods, but we know that and meanwhile these warnings
	    make the testsuite output noisy.  Fix use of deprecated form
	    of Runtime.exec() in the doxygen example.

2024-02-28: wsfulton
            #1754 Fix compilation errors in generated code when instantiating a templated
            static method within a template (non-static methods and constructors were
            always okay). For example:

              template <typename T> class X {
                template <class InputIterator>
                  static void fn(InputIterator first, InputIterator last) { ... }
              };
              class SimpleIterator { ... };

              %extend X<int> {
                %template(fn) fn<SimpleIterator>;
              }
